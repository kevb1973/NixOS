To Update this App
==================

First, unlink the old result. Garbage collect to remove from store.
> unlink ./result
> nix-collect-garbage -d (del-user-gens)

Get the hash for the new version.
> nix-prefetch-git --url https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm --rev "v1.12"

Edit the default.nix to add the new version number and hash.

Then build the new package:
> nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./default.nix {}'

If package builds, link the executable to ~/bin
> ln -s ~/Code/clifm-nix/result/bin/clifm ~/bin/clifm


Note: The above is from when I did a manual build of the package. By
incorporating the nix file into configuration.nix, the package is built
as part of the nixos-rebuild process and linking the binary is not needed.

The nix file will still need to be updated for new versions using the process
above to get he needed hash from github. Just update the nix file and then
rebuild the system to get the new version.
